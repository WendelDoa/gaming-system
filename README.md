# gaming-system
This is an OOP project created by me in the Java language. It basically has a games and users system, where games, users can be registered or removed and users can add favorite games. This system contains data persistence, a UML project and a figma project.

Here is the project link on Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/lZGApg9X1shz1lQkzWnfoe/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=E7qTV1R1sJesKiGn-1
